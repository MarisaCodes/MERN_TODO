# MERN TODO App

---

### Backend

- Express/Node js has been used for the backend

- Express is used to make an api routes for the frontend to use to interact with the databse

- The database lives on Mongodb, mongoose used for interacting with MongoDb

- Morgan middleware package used to log server status and request status

---

### Frontend

- React was used for the frontend

- proxy had to be setup to avoid CORS policy error "http-proxy-middle-ware" package

---

### To run

- Clone or download zip

- Run `cd frontend` and then `npm install`

- Then run `npm start`

- Run `cd ../backend` and then `npm install`

- Run `npm start`

- This will only work if you have mongodb locally installed (and Mongodb services running/ check task manager for that) and if the mongodb connection url is the same as mine.
